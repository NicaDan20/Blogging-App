            <p class="justified">If your business collects or processes credit cards, then having and executing a sound
              <strong>Payment
                Card Industry Data Security Standard</strong> (PCI DSS) compliance strategy is essential, and also a
              regulatory requirement. To prevent fraud and data breaches from insecure networks and
              payment systems, the five major credit card brands established PCI standards in 2004 that
              regulate the payment industry today. Not securing customers' personal credit information can
              lead to stiff penalties and damage to your business' reputation and bottom line.</p>
    
            <p class="justified">It might seem like a daunting task to comply with PCI-DSS, the maze of standards and issues
              seems like
              a lot to handle for large organizations, let alone smaller companies - yet, compliance is becoming
              more and more important, and it may not be as troublesome as it is commonly assumed, especially if you have
              the right partner. Some of the advantages that ensue by becoming PCI compliant are as follows: </p>
    
            <ul class="dbc_list">
              <li>Being PCI compliant means that your systems are <strong>secure</strong>, and your customers can
                <strong>trust</strong> you with their sensitive payment
                information.</li>
              <li>PCI Compliance improves your <strong>reputation</strong> with acquiers and payment brands.</li>
              <li>Meeting PCI Compliance means you are <strong>better</strong> prepared to comply with additional
                regulations, such as HIPAA, FINRA, SOX and others.</li>
              <li>PCI Compliance will likely <strong>improve</strong> IT Infrastructure efficiency</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p class="justified">It might seem like a costly endeavor to become PCI Compliant as the process often involves
              third-
              party experts, annual assessments, and investments in cybersecurity and infrastructure.
              However, non-compliance risks vulnerability to ransomware attacks, data breaches, fines, card
              replacement costs, audits, and investigationsâ€”not to mention damage to one's reputation.
