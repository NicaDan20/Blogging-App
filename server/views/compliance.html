            <h5>What is IT compliance?</h5>

            The line between IT security and IT compliance is easily blurred. Compliance is often misunderstood as
            being synonimous with data protection but that is not the case. While the branch of IT Security deals with
            the implementation of strategies and technologies that protect your data from malicious attacks, IT
            Compliance is defined as a set of rules, principles and standards a company must meet in order to operate
            legally. The requirements relate to the measures used for implementing IT Security strategies
            in your company. Most compliance requirements stem from legal bases or other official regulations and are
            absolutely mandatory in order to have your business' activity approved. If companies violate these
            regulations, it can be punished with heavy fines and even imprisonment for the responsible parties.

            <h5>Who needs compliance?</h5>

            <p class="justified">
              Basically, every company and organization using an IT System (which basically means all) must adhere to IT
              Compliance requirements.
              The relevant government authorities define the IT Compliance regulations. Of course, the regulations that
              a company must comply with differ depending on
              the field of work, company size, number of customers and overall societal role of each company. For
              example, the strictest IT Compliance will apply to companies including but not limited to the energy,
              healthcare, food, transport, government, finance and insurance sectors.

              Compliance for such companies is extremely extensive and will often require help from 3rd party providers
              to meet all the requirements. In general, companies are subject to random compliance checks by supervisory
              authorities.
