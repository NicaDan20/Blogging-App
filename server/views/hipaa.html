              <p class="justified"> Healthcare organizations have invested heavily in technology with the intent of improving the quality of care while maintaining regulatory compliances.
                Such organizations are constantly pressured into being up-to-date in a dynamic industry where regulations, cost restrictions,
                compliance and cyber security challenges compete for funding. Thus, it is not always
                easy to make the right decisions when it comes to updating technology in such circumstances. </p>
            
              <p class="justified"> New technologies, from electronic medical records and medical devices to mobile and Web
              applications, allow doctors to collect more information to study patient histories and to improve the health status of patients, sometimes making the difference.
              Such technologies and related data are constantly interacting, exchanging health information
              through increasingly complex systems, which increases risks and vulnerabilities. Doctors are no
              longer the only custodians of sensitive compliance health information. Today, for example,
              people who manage the storage of data also have access to this information, and they are
              responsible for its safety. </p>
            
              <p class="justified">Health IT makes it possible for healthcare providers to efficiently manage patient care through the secure use and sharing of a patient's information. By developing <strong>secure and private</strong> digital health records
                for people and making said information easily accessible through IT, the quality and the cost effectiveness of patient's care is improved. Health care providers benefit from accurate and complete information about a
                patient's health, allowing for the best possible care. This can also help in diagnosing health problems more efficiently and timely. The security of a patient's information allows for discreet sharing of a patient's dossier,
                allowing more transparent communication between the healthcare provider, the patient and it's family. There are more side benefits of an effective health IT system running in your clinic such as electronic prescribing,
                electronic medical records (EMRs, EHRs, PHRs), computerized registries, and more. Therefore, it is highly important for your clinic to keep up with the times, and improve your patient care through improving your IT.  </p>
            
              <h5>HIPAA Compliance.</h5>
              <p class="justified">HIPAA is a set of special privacy and security standards for certain health information, which
              known as HIPAA Privacy Rule (privacy standard) and Security Rule (security standard)
              respectively. Standards apply to healthcare organizations, such as healthcare facilities,
              insurance companies, and medical billing centers. Of course HIPAA Privacy Rule provides
              federal protection for personal health information used by healthcare providers. This provides
              patients with a set of rights to this information.</p>
