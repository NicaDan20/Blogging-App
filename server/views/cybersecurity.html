            <p class="justified">COVID-19 has driven <strong>radical</strong> change in businesses, as the efforts to
              manage the pandemic have pushed people into their homes, working from home
              became more and more prevalent. Enterprises have been forced to rapidly adapt to the new working models - at
              the heart of which lying a complex
