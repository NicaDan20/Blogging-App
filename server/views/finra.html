            <p class="justified"> Whether your business is processing electronic payments or brokering stocks and bonds, the
              sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that you transmit makes your firm a target for
              cybercriminals to steal money from online transactions.
              Did you know that financial services firms are <strong>300</strong> times more likely to be cyberattacked than
              any other industry? Most of those data breaches are carried out using web application attacks,
              but threats continue to occur using credit card skimmers on ATMs. Since financial service
              companies tend to use third-party solutions such as cloud services and various communications
              channels, customer data is even more vulnerable than in other industries. </p>
              
              <p class="justified">Accounting is one of the domains where IT has become intrinsic to its work flow. Managing documents, private data, bank accounts, statements, bills and
                just about anything that involves paperwork is much easier nowadays due to the advancements in technology. However, advancement has brought a number of pitfalls and challenges with it, some old, such as data storage and backup,
                and some new, such as protecting your client's data from malicious attacks, data theft, and server optimizations. Cybercriminals often target accounting firms because
                of all the confidential information such as email adresses, bank accounts or other personal/business related data which can be easily accessed if your systems are unprotected.
                Even more, during tax season accounting firms need 100% network uptime, they cannot waste days or weeks because of faulty systems.
                Therefore, having a well setup IT Infrastructure will also boost productivity and ensure a stable workflow.</p>
              
              <p class="justified"> To proactively address the risk of data breaches in your business, the Financial Industry
              Regulatory Authority (FINRA) recommends developing a comprehensive cybersecurity program
              including steps in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity
              Framework. DeepBlue Computers has the professional expertise and hands-on knowledge required in
              helping its clients to be FINRA compliant. </p>
