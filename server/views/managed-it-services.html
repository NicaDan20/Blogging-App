            <h4>What is Managed IT?</h4>
    
            <p class="justified">Managed IT refers to business owners outsourcing their IT services to a third-party known as a
            managed IT service provider. These providers assume full responsibility for the development
            and maintenance of the business' IT services.</p>
            
            <h5>Benefits of Managed IT Services</h5>
            <p class="justified">Business owners gain several benefits from outsourcing their IT services to managed IT service
            providers:</p>
            
            <ul class="dbc_list">
              <li><strong>Cost savings:</strong> Business owners save money when using managed IT service providers
            because hardware, software, as well as maintenance costs, are assumed by the
            managed IT service provider. All the business owner typically pays is a fixed monthly fee
            to the service provider.</li>
              <li><strong>Expertise:</strong> Managed IT service providers have employees with the necessary skill sets to
            provide the necessary IT service. Business owners no longer have to concern themselves
            with hiring skilled IT personnel.</li>
              <li><strong>Core business focus:</strong> Outsourcing of their IT processes to managed IT service providers
            allows business owners focus their time and resources on their core business products.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="justified">Network outages for managed IT services, security threats, business continuity — these are just
            handful the information technology challenges that businesses face on daily basis. But for small,
            medium-sized enterprises, maintaining in-house IT staff to tackle these issues is rarely a cost-
            effective solution. Managed service providers represent the ideal alternative. Thanks to
            economies of scale, predictable pricing, reduced capital outlay, MSPs can provide compelling
            savings over in-house approaches. What's more, leading MSPs offer the benefits best-of-breed
            technology, specialist expertise — often delivering service quality that would be impossible
            SME achieve alone.</p>
